# Overly Mothered
## Script
So how many of us love our mothers.  It's a pretty loaded question right?  Mothers are loved by everyone.  Keep your hands up.  Now how many of you, especially the asians are comfortable expressing this?  Thought so.  

I've always had a mother that was loving and did what she thought was best for me and my brothers. She's always doing things and making sure we are ok - it's probably the best case of "service design" I've come across - but that's a different story.

Since I now live half way across the world, I've started noticing something that I'm not sure if I should be worried or happy about.  Every time I go to see my folks, I get a serious case of being "overly mothered".  Looking back, it's always been there, but now that the meetings are less frequent, the impact and consequences of being overly mothered are more serious then ever.

So what do I mean overly motherd? We all know the feeling.  It's when your mother takes all the good traits of being a mother - feeding you, making sure you are warm, doing your laundry, and so on.  But in a way where its relentless.  Now don't get me wrong, I do love a biscuit with my tea, but do I like the same biscuit with the same tea for the rest of my life?

The relentless pursit of satisfaction through feeding you is just one clasic trait of being overly mothered.  I remember one day my mum came back with a new biscuit.  Oatmeal and raison cookies.   Delisious.  Ate them all up.

My mother would always say "ngon khong?" which is "is it nice?" in vietnamese.  I'd reply that I liked them and they go well with tea.  Little did I know that this would set off a chain of behaviout and pswudo psycohological abuse.

It was a trap. Suddenly I notice more and more of these delicious raisons and oat cookies everywhere I turned.  They were in the biscuit box, the kitchen cuboard and I found a load of them in the storeroom.

It was the only biscuit. Every team time was faced with dread.  "An de, an de" "Your favourite".  Words whcih strike terror into me to this day.  

There was no way around it.  All we had to eat was the same damn biscuit forever.  I'm certain that this is the reason I don't like sweet stuff anymore.  Thanks mum.

It got to the point where my brothers and I were scared to say we liked something.  Imagine that.  A small child being scared to express interest in something for fear of having to do that one thing forever.  It's really messed me up as an adult - I'm very non challant and chill about a lot of things.  I say it's part of the cool image I try to pursue, but in reality I'm scared to commit incase my options are limited.

A little is nice.  Too much of one thing and one thing forever is horrible.

Looking back it was a way that my mum would tell me she loved me.
